This is setup to use ethernet cards "boot on lan" feature with Debian netboot.
It is shamefully based on http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/478 
and advertised at http://yeupou.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/having-homemade-aliases-functions-and-such-available-to-every-interactive-shells/


To set this up:
---------------

On the server (you have a home server, right? *plonk*), 

Put this directory somewhere clever, like /srv/pxe for instance (yes, that's what I did; but you can put it in /opt/my/too/long/path/i/cannot/remember if you really really want).

Run the gnulinux/update.sh script to get kernels and initrds. By default, it fetches debian and ubuntu stuff. If it went well, you should have several *-linux and *-initrd.gz files in gnulinux/ plus a generated file named default inside pxelinux.cfg/
You may add a symlink to this script inside /etc/cron.monthly so you keep stuff up-to-date.

Then, you must install a "Trivial FTP Daemon" on you local server which will, in the context of PXE (Preboot Execution Environment), serve these files you just got:
      apt-get install tftpd-hpa
      update-rc.d tftpd-hpa defaults
Edit /etc/default/tftpd-hpa, especially TFTP_DIRECTORY setting (you know, /opt/my/what/the/...).

Finally, you must update your DHCP Daemon so it advertises we're running PXE (filename and next-server options). With ISC dhcpd, in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf, for my subnet, I have now:
      subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
	
	# PXE / boot on lan
	filename "pxelinux.0";
	next-server 192.168.1.1;
      }

Obviously, you wont forget to do:
      invoke-rc.d isc-dhcp-server restart
      invoke-rc.d tftpd-hpa start


To use it:
----------

On your client,

Go in the BIOS, look for "boot on lan" and whatever crap it may be called (it varies greatly), activate it. Then boot. It'll do some DHCP magic to find the path to the PXE and the menu should be printed on your screen at some point.
